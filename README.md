### Project Overview
This Project aims to analyze Apple's stock over the past five years and see how their financials correlate to an increase or decrease in stock price. 
To dive deeper, I compared Apple's financials to Microsoft to see how the two tech giants perform relative to each other.

In the initial data preparation phase, I performed the following tasks:

 2. Data cleaning and formatting: Ensured accurate data types, and structured data for analysis 


### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring stock and financial data to answer key questions, such as:

 - Has Apple's stock increae over the years? How does their financials correlate with it's increase or decrease in stock price.
   
 - How does Apple's financials compare to Microsoft?
   
 - What are the highest and lowest performing prices?
   
 - Has trading volume increased or decreased? What could have caused the volume to increase or decrease?
 

### Data Analysis

Ratio Analysis: Gather financial information from balance sheet, cash flow, and income statement to calculate key financial ratios (ROA, ROE, Debt-to-Equity, Current Ratio).

Trend Analysis: Analyzed trends in Apple's stock and financials measures (Net Income, Current Liabilities).

Comperative Analysis: Conducted a side-by-side analysis on Microsoft and Apple's key financial metrics



### Results/Findings

The analysis results are summarized as follows:
 1. Apple has an aggressive approach to generating revenue compared to Micosoft more conservative approach.
    
 2. Apple's high stock price can correlate to it's aggressive approach.
  
 3. Apple's ROE and Debt-to-Equity are much higher than Microsoft, which can increase returns but with higher financial risk.
